# Tensorflow Project Template
This project aims to give a general well **OOP designed** project template for those who deal with **Deep Learning** projects using **TensorFlow**.

A related work([MrGemy95/Tensorflow-Project-Template](https://github.com/MrGemy95/Tensorflow-Project-Template)) is proposed to provide a tensorflow project template that combines simplcity, best practice for folder structure and good OOP design.

For more flexiablity on data importing & more training paradigms, we proposed this work.
